Assignment 3: Meixuan (May) Chen, Shariq Dharani, Matthew Wade

Ensure the 'group_23_assignment3' folder has two folders titled 'a3_novelvisualization' and 'a3_wordfrequency' within. 

Generate 3 text files ('allwords.txt', 'uniquewords.txt' and 'wordfrequency.txt') by running 'extract_words.py'.

Open 'a3_novelvisualization' and 'a3_wordfrequency' directories. Run their respective pde files. Required txt/font files are stored inside data directories, so pde files should execute normally. 

Open 'anthem_wordle.png" to view the word cloud image created from 'allwords.txt'
