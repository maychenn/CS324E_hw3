Assignment 3 was a collaboration between May Chen, Shariq Dharani, Matthew Wade. May and Matthew split work on 'extract_words.py'. Matthew wrote the 'allwords' part and May wrote the 'uniquewords' and 'wordfrequency' parts. Shariq worked on the Wordle and 'a3_novelvisualization' parts of the project, and May worked on the 'a3_wordfrequency' part. 

***Novel Visualization***

For novel visualization, font 'Kano' was chosen for readability and simplicity. I chose the color palette (olive, grey and yellow) after looking at the many different covers for Anthem, as its dark and dreary theme fits the palette as well. Anthem takes place in a dystopian future in which the concept of individuality has been eliminated. I decided on a font size of 30 in reference to the main character Liberty 5-3000. Since individuality is a common theme in the story, I decided on the more common (shorter) words having boring, darker colors (grey, dark olive) and rarer (longer) words having a brighter color (yellow). 

***Word Frequency***

For the word frequency visualization, the decreasing height of the bar represents the decreasing number of words in that word frequency. The increasing brightness of the yellow color represents the increasing frequency of the words or the decreasing "uniqueness." We chose to represent the word frequency this way because of the frequency and significance of the "I" in the novel. Since a major theme in the story is that every person is important and significant, even though there is so many of us. In that way, the increasing brightness of the color represents the increasing significance of the word. Note that, we added a multiplier for the brightness in order to increase the visibility of the gradient.
